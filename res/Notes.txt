NOTES:
	- end goal is to be able to not have to use fixed buffer streams, and just be able to use the PNG File's reader and write directly to a chunk
	s data field.
	- perhaps this involves some sort of chunk name/size peek, or just have another read function that only reads in the chunk name/size at first, then we can determine if it's an idat chunk, after which we can just use the png file's reader and the chunk's writer (still need to make)


TODO:
	- make a writer within the Chunk structure
	- make another read function within the PNGFile structure that only reads the name/size of the chunk
	- use the PNGFile's reader and the Chunk's writer to zlib-decompress the IDAT chunk's data.
